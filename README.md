# LeDoc

LeDoc is a lightweight, feature-rich document viewer and editor that is inspired by Google Docs. It supports exports to a variety of document formats and provides intuitive tools for editing documents, with real-time editing in a collborative document. Available at https://le-doc.vercel.app/. The app uses Nextjs 15, Convex (for the database), Liveblocks (for collaboration) and Clerk (for authentication).

## Features

- **Multi-Format Support**: View and manage files in formats such as PDF, DOCX, TXT, and more.
- **Fast and Lightweight**: Optimised for speed and low resource usage.
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Invite users to your organisation and collaborate on the same documents. 
  - Using [Liveblocks](https://liveblocks.io/) I've implemented multi-user collaboration, just like Google Docs. You can see other people typing on your document. Users must be added to the same organisation to collaborate.
